## What are bonds

- Bonds are debt securities issued by
  - corporations
  - governments
  - municipalities
- Bonds ~= IOUs
  - Investors lend money (creditor) to organisations (issuer/debtor)
  - Receive interest payments.
  - Obligated to return the principal on a predetermined date in the future
  - Have priority claim on assets in the event of bankruptcy

## Characteristics
- Par or face value is the bond’s denomination and the amount returned to the investor upon maturity.
- Par <> price of a bond
- Price fluctuates throughout the lifetime of a bond.
  - Price > par = premium
  - Price < par = discount
- Price is generally quoted as a percentage of face value. e.g. 98 means 98% of the bond’s $1,000 par value, or $980.
- Coupon rate (or just coupon) = annual interest rate paid to investors as compensation for the loan.
- Coupon payments are generally made semi-annually unless otherwise stated.
- Maturity = term of the bond’s life.
- Bonds range in maturity from 3M to 100Y.
- At maturity
  - Face value is repaid to the investor
  - Interest payments stop
- Call provisions give an issuer the option, at its discretion, to redeem bonds (pay back the principal) prior to maturity after an initial non-call period.
  - Bonds are called when market interest rates fall
  - Company can issue new bonds with lower coupon rates 
  - To compensate investors for the reinvestment risk and unknown final term of investment, callable bonds generally offer higher yields than non-callable alternatives.
- Credit rating is usually a reflection of an issuer’s ability to pay interest and principal and may not fully represent its creditworthiness.
  - Independent rating agencies rate based on
     - issuer’s financial condition
     - economic and debt characteristics
     - specific revenue sources securing the bond.
   - Issuers with lower credit ratings generally offer investors higher yields to compensate for the additional credit risk. 
   - Bonds with comparable ratings may trade at different yields, which may further indicate the market’s perception of risk.
   
## Price/Yield Relationship

- Yield = bond’s coupon rate relative to its current market price.
  - IR rise => Price of an existing bond falls => yield rise

The two most frequently referenced yields are:
### Yield-to-maturity (YTM)
- Generally, YTM for a new-issue security is equal to its coupon rate.

### Yield-to-call (YTC), or yield-to-worst case (YWC)
- Call features and is purchased at a premium.
- The prices of callable bonds will not rise as much as those of non-callable securities because investors are not willing to pay more due to the increased chance of a call.
